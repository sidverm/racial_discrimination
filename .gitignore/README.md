# racial_discrimination 
This is a submission for the Springboard assignment on inferential statistics. We were given a dataset that studied racial discrimination
in the job market in the US, and asked to answer specific questions using inferential statistics. 

The original questions as well as my answers are there in the Jupyter Notebook sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_2.ipynb
