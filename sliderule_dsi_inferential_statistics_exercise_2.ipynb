    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "A study conducted by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan in Chicago and Boston between 2000 and 2002 confirms that there exists racial discrimination in the job market in the United States. A random sample of 4870 resumes was selected and their names were jumbled up. CVs which were identical in all other respects were randomly allotted white sounding and black sounding names. Many such CVs were sent to relevant industries and whoever got an interview request was recorded. It was found that while 6.44 % black sounding names got an interview call, about 9.65 % white sounding names got a request for being interviewed, in other words, for otherwise identical resumes, if simply the name of the candidates sounded like a white, the chances of him or her being called for an interview were 49.7 % higher!\n",

Margin of error aroud the 9.65% of \"white callback rate\" was estimated as 1.54% with 99% confidence. It is clear that effect size is well outside the margin of error in both measurements. \n",
